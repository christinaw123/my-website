            <h3>Artistic & Technological Concept</h3>
            <p>
				Inspired by the idea of reciprocity, we wondered what it would mean if trees took back from humans what we've taken from them. 
				In that case, what would it mean to save a tree?  Using Unity, a VR environment is crafted where the landscape is colored in reds 
				and pinks, a reminder of the blood that once flowed. In this new world, participants witness firsthand what it means to “feed the trees". 
				As blood bubbles rise from their hands, their health deteriorates until the inevitable end. The digital realm is merged seamlessly with 
				the physical with the use of projections and sound, creating a multi-dimensional experience that blurs the boundaries between reality and 
				imagination. As participants immerse themselves in the virtual world, giving their blood to the tree, they feel the vibrations of the tree's 
				heartbeat strengthening. Meanwhile, spectators outside the virtual space are treated to a mesmerizing display as the participant's hand shoots 
				out a network of red from the tree's heart to the branches above, each beat synchronized with their own heartbeat.  The tree itself is crafted 
				from humble materials such as wire, cardboard pipes, and scrunched paper, representing the lesser condition from our world to the VR world. Even 
				its heart is created from simple foil construction paper. Through this immersive art piece, viewers are invited to reflect upon the intricate dance 
				of give and take between humanity and nature. It serves as a powerful reminder of our interconnectedness with the natural world and urges us to consider
				 the consequences of our actions on the delicate balance of our ecosystem.

            <h3>Process & Development</h3>
            <p>
              The development of this project involved several stages: ideation, prototyping, user testing, and final installation. 
              We experimented with different VR platforms and feedback loops to create a seamless experience.
            </p>

			<h3>Storyline</h3>
			<h4>Stage I: Introducing the Alternative Universe</h4>
			<p>
			When the person walks into the room, they “enter” the alternative universe where plants dominate the world and there are no humans to be found in the world. They will be prompted to put on the VR headset and armband(attached to the physical tree) and the simulation will start. 
			</p>
			<h4>Stage II: Depletion</h4>
			<p>During the simulation, the user will physically experience their arm being restrained as the armband tightens. In the VR world, they will be able to look down and see that the tree branch is draining blood/energy from them. There will also be a health bar and they will see their health bar go down as the tree energy bar goes up. Eventually, their vision will fade to black as they “die” in the VR world. The tree branches will also be growing as energy is being sucked from the human.
			</p>
			<h4>Stage III: Consumption</h4>
			<p>
			After they face the black screen, they will be prompted to take off their headset and they will see that they are now “inside” of the tree. The walls of the room will be bloody. There will be a screen near the door where they can see that the tree they were attached to no longer looks like a normal tree. The tree becomes almost flesh-like.

            <h3>Reflections & Impact</h3>
            <p>After completing the installation, I reflected on how VR can be used to address and draw attention to 
				pressing environmental issues. Our installation was able to instill the feeling of urgency and the message
				of reflecting on human relationships with nature got across with all age groups.
				The feedback from participants was invaluable in understanding the impact of such methods of interactive
				digital art on real-world as our project was inspired by similar exhibitions executed by TeamLabs Japan.
